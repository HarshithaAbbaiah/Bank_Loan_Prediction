# Bank_Loan_Prediction
Predicting personal loan approval using machine learning (Random Forest) with SHAP for explainable AI insights. Includes EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

## Objective
To build a predictive model that determines whether a bank customer will accept a personal loan offer based on their demographic and financial data.
